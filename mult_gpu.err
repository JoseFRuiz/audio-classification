GPU Driver '550' detected
Some weights of Wav2Vec2Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision
